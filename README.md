# Table-of-User-Information
This project displays a styled and searchable client table using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  The table contains client details like ID, Name, Age, and Address. A live search bar filters the table based on any keyword (e.g. name, age, ID, or address). As you type, the table updates instantly without needing to reload the page.
